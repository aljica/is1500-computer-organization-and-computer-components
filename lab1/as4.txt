If we have $a0 as -1 then we will get stuck in an infinite loop
because our while-loop variable will never be equal to zero.
Ideally we should have some check in our delay function to ensure
the input parameter is actually greater than (or equal to) zero
to avoid this problem.

If we have $a0 as 0 then the delay will be ms = 0, i.e. no delay.
The delay function will be called but we will never enter the while loop.
